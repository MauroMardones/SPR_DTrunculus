## LBSPR Modeling

### Biological and fishery parameters wedge clam

```{r}
#Create a new LB_pars Object
#To create a new LB_pars object you use the new function:
MyPars <- new("LB_pars")
MyPars23 <- new("LB_pars")

#You can see the elements or slots of the LB_pars object using the
#slotNames function:
#slotNames(MyPars)
```

The model needs specifications related to both biological and fishery parameters according to species evaluated. In a descriptive way, the main parameter sets are described as follows;

**Biology**

-   von Bertalanffy asymptotic length `Linf`
-   M/K ratio (natural mortality)divided by von Bertalanffy K coefficient) `MK`
-   Length at 50% maturity (`L50`)
-   Length at 95% maturity (`L95`)

**Fishery**

-   Length at 50% selectivity (`SL50`)
-   Length at 95% selectivity (`SL95`)
-   Biological Reference Point (BRP). F/M ratio (`FM`) or Spawning Potential Ratio (`SPR`). If you specify both, the F/M value will be ignored.

**Size Classes**

-Width of the length classes (`BinWidth`)

### Model Estimation LBSPR

Recent work has shown that under equilibrium conditions (that is, constant F and no recruitment variability) and assuming the von Bertalanffy growth equation, constant natural mortality for all ages, and logistic or jack-knife selectivity, standardization of the composition of lengths of two populations with the same ratio of natural mortality to growth rate (*M/k*) and the same ratio of mortality by fishing to natural mortality (*F/M*) will be identical [@Hordyk2016]. Extension of this model to incorporate length-at-age variability and logistic selectivity confirms that, at equilibrium, the composition of the predicted duration of catch of an exploited population is primarily determined by the ratios of M/k and F/M. The analytical models developed in @Hordyk2014 suggest that with knowledge of the asymptotic von Bertalanffy length $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in $CVL_{\infty}$, the ratio of total mortality to the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (*Z/k*) for a given population can be estimated from a representative sample of the size structure of the catch. If *M/k* (or parameters) is also known, then the results of @Hordyk2016 suggest that it is possible to estimate F/M from the composition of the catch. Often the F/M ratio has been used as a biological reference point when is 1 [@Zhou2012].

The LBSPR model requires the following parameters: an estimate of the M/k ratio, $L_{\infty}$, $CVL_{\infty}$, and knowledge of maturity by length (maturity ogive), both set parameters know in krill. This model uses data on composition by catch sizes to estimate intrinsic productivity or Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR). This concept was extracted from @Goodyear1993, where the ratio of lifetime average egg production per recruit (EPR) was calculated for fished and no fished (virgin condition) resources. An algorithm route for the calculation of the SPR is the following;

$${SPR}=\frac{EPR_{fished}}{EPR_{nofished}}$$ where;

$$
EPR_{fished} =
\sum_{a}
\begin{cases}
 E_{a},  a = 0  \\
 e^{-Z_{{a-1}}a} {E_a}, 0 < a  < a_\le{max}
 \end{cases}       
$$ 

where $Z_a$ = $M+F_a$, and $E$ is egg production at age assumed to be proportional to weight;

$$E_a \in  Mat_a W_a$$ on the other hand, the calculation of the reproductive potential is the same as that of those captured without F; $$
EPR_{nofished} =
\sum_{a}
 E_ae^{-M_a}
$$ Assuming that egg production is proportional to the size of mature fish, relative fecundity-at-size is given by;

$$
Fec_{L,g} = Mat_{L,g} L^b
$$ where b is value of the exponent to reflect differente size fecunditity relationship and g is the fraction of recruits to group.

Assuming reasonable estimates of the M/K ratio, $L_{\infty}$ (or $CVL_{\infty}$), size-at-maturity, the parameters F/M, $SL_{50}$, and $SL_{95}$ can be estimated from a representative sample of the length structure of the catch by minimizing the following multinomial negative loglikelihood function (NLL):

$$
NLL =
argmin\sum_{i}
 O_i ln\frac{\hat{P}_i}{\hat{O}_i}
$$

where $O_i$ and $\hat{O}_i$ are the observed number and proportion in length class i, respectively, and $\hat{P}_i$ is the model estimate of the probability in length class i [@Hordyk2016].


The LBSPR package can be used to generate the expected size composition, the SPR, and relative yield for a given set of biological and exploitation pattern parameters. The output of the `LBSPRsim` function is an object of class `LB_obj`. This is another LBSPR object, and contains all of the information from the `LB_pars` object and the output of the `LBSPRsim` function.

It is important to note that the F/M ratio reported in the LBSPR model refers to the apical F over the adult natural mortality rate. That is, the value for fishing mortality refers to the highest level of F experienced by any single size class [@Hordyk2014]. If the selectivity pattern excludes all but the largest individuals from being exploited, it is possible to have a very high F/M ratio in a sustainable fishery (high SPR) and visceverse. Note that only the life history parameters need to be specified for the estimation model. The exploitation parameters will be estimated [@Hordyk2014].

Two objects are required to fit the LBSPR model to length data: life-history parameters (`LB_pars`) described previously (2.4. section) and size compositions (`LB_lengths`), which contains the length frequency data. We provide a set of global size data and also by strata, with which we will be able to identify the spatial differences of the potential.

```{r}
MyLengths <- new("LB_lengths")
slotNames(MyLengths)


MyLengths23 <- new("LB_lengths")
slotNames(MyLengths23)

```

However, it is probably easier to create the `LB_lengths` object by directly reading in a `.csv`. A length frequency data of krill set with multiple years (2001-2020) by strata in 48.1 Subarea.

```{r message=F, warning=FALSE}
Lendt <- new("LB_lengths", 
             LB_pars=MyPars, 
             file=("data/LDF_Dtrunculus.csv"), 
             dataType="freq",
             sep=",",
             header=T)

Lendt23 <- new("LB_lengths", 
             LB_pars=MyPars23, 
             file=("data/LDF_Dtrunculus.csv"), 
             dataType="freq",
             sep=",",
             header=T)
```


### Fit the Model by strata

The LBSPR model is fitted by strata using the `LBSPRfit` function. 

```{r message=FALSE}
fitdt <- LBSPRfit(MyPars, Lendt)
fitdt23 <- LBSPRfit(MyPars23, Lendt23)
```

# RESULTS

## Model Perfomance

The results demonstrate good fits of the size structure distribution model for krill across the strata. The model accurately captures the distribution patterns of size classes, indicating its effectiveness in characterizing the population structure. The model successfully captures the variations in size distribution, reflecting the natural variability in krill populations across different strata. These findings suggest that the model can be utilized as a valuable tool for understanding and predicting size structure dynamics in krill populations (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5)).

```{r Figure5, fig.cap="Fit of the model to the data of lengths in all strata"}
dtcom1 <-plotSize(fitdt,
                  scales = "fixed",
         Title="D. trunculus")+
  thememau
dtcom1
dtcom123 <-plotSize(fitdt23,
                  scales = "fixed",
         Title="D. trunculus 23")+

          dtcom123,

```


The difference between the observed accumulated size compositions for each stratum and compare it with the expected size composition at a target SPR (75% SPR). In the simulation of the structure in its virgin condition (without fishing), the red bars represent each stratum. Additionally, the overlap with the average structures observed during the years of fishery monitoring can be visualized. The SSWI Gerlache and EI strata exhibit the greatest differences from the simulated structure, possibly due to the significant contribution of juveniles in these strata. Conversely, the BS and JO strata demonstrate the closest resemblance to the simulated structure (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure6)).

```{r Figure6, fig.cap="Difference between the observed accumulated size structure for each stratum related SPR objective", fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
yr <- 5 # first year of data

dtcom <- plotTarg(MyPars, Lendt, yr=yr,
                  Cols = c(2,4),
                  size.axtex = 8,
                  title="49 Linf",
                  targtext = FALSE)+
  thememau 

dtcom23 <- plotTarg(MyPars23, Lendt23, yr=yr,
                  Cols = c(2,4),
                  size.axtex = 8,
                  title="48 Linf",
                  targtext = FALSE)+
  thememau 
ggarrange(dtcom,
          dtcom23,
          ncol = 2, common.legend = T)
```

Furthermore, ogive maturity curve specific to each stratum and year, as well as the estimated length selectivity curve, are presented in (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7)). These curves offer crucial insights into the fishery's impact on the population and its reproductive status, providing measures of the population's vulnerability to fishing mortality. Notably, the Brainsfield stratum stands out with a lower proportion of mature individuals, suggesting a higher prevalence of juveniles. It is important to note that the same maturity parameters were applied across all strata.

```{r Figure7, fig.cap= "Maturity curves by strata", out.width="80%"}

dtmat <- plotMat(fitdt,
        useSmooth = TRUE,
        Title="49 Linf")+
  thememau 
dtmat23 <- plotMat(fitdt23,
        useSmooth = TRUE,
        Title="48 Linf")+
  thememau 
ggarrange(dtmat,
          dtmat23,
          ncol=1, common.legend = T,
          legend = "bottom")
```

## Comparing producivity between years and Stratas

The analysis of the krill population's reproductive potential across different years and strata reveals significant differences. Brainsfield and Gerlache strata exhibit a low reproductive potential below the proposed management target of 75% in the last year, with values of 0.121 and 0.085, respectively, falling even below the limit reference point. This condition arises from the concentration of a substantial number of immature individuals (juveniles) in these strata, which are being exploited by the fishery, thereby hindering their reproductive cycles from completing. On the contrary, the Elephant Island stratum demonstrates higher spawning potential ratio (SPR) levels in recent years, reaching 0.421 in 2019, which aligns closer to the management objective. This discrepancy is attributed to the spatial distribution of krill, as the Elephant Island stratum possesses a larger proportion of adult individuals compared to other strata.

The results of the methods in the reference setting are compared to the obtained under overstimation/underestimation in intrinsic productivity regarding asymptotic length von Bertalanffy $L_{\infty}$ parameter in krill. First, it was possible to identify that for all strata, the impact of low $L_{\infty}$ ranges under the base model (60 mm) overestimates the level of reproductive potential krill with values between 42% and 32% (Bransfield and Elephant Island strata respectively). Regarding higher $L_{\infty}$ settings, the model tends to underestimate the reproductive potential with values between -25% and -30% (Gerlache and Joinville strata) Figure \@ref(fig:Figure9),  Table \@ref(tab:Table3).

Regarding the three growth levels of the species (high, medium, low) referred to the parameter $k$, it was possible to identify that high and medium growth types result in very low SPR (spawning potential ratio) estimates compared to slow and medium growth. In fact, with high individual growth, the model estimates that SPR levels would be very close to the target management levels (75% SPR) and far from the limit reference level of 20% (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure10),  Table \@ref(tab:Table5)).

## Analysis to three Subareas (48.1, 48.2 and 48.3)

Reading data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datdir <- setwd("~/DOCAS/LBSPR_Krill")
Len481 <- new("LB_lengths", 
             LB_pars=MyPars, 
             file=paste0(datdir, "/lenght481_nochina.csv"), 
             dataType="freq",
             sep=",",
             header=T)

Len482 <- new("LB_lengths", 
             LB_pars=MyPars, 
             file=paste0(datdir, "/lenght482_nochina.csv"),
             dataType="freq",
             sep=",",
             header=T)

Len483 <- new("LB_lengths", 
             LB_pars=MyPars, 
             file=paste0(datdir, "/lenght483_nochina.csv"), 
             dataType="freq",
             sep=",",
             header=T)
```

The LBSPR model is fitted by strata using the `LBSPRfit` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 
fit481 <- LBSPRfit(MyPars, Len481)
fit482 <- LBSPRfit(MyPars, Len482)
fit483 <- LBSPRfit(MyPars, Len483)
```

Now, to paper propose, we estimate `SPR` to all subareas (48.1, 48.2 and 48.3)

```{r}
# Get values estimated

spr481 <- as.data.frame(cbind(fit481 @Years, 
                             fit481 @SPR,
                             fit481 @Vars[,4])) 
colnames(spr481) <- c("Year","SPR", "Var")
spr481$SPRv <- rep("481", nrow(spr481))

spr482 <- as.data.frame(cbind(fit482 @Years, 
                             fit482 @SPR,
                             fit482 @Vars[,4])) 
colnames(spr482) <- c("Year","SPR", "Var")
spr482$SPRv <- rep("482", nrow(spr482))

spr483 <- as.data.frame(cbind(fit483 @Years, 
                             fit483 @SPR,
                             fit483 @Vars[,4])) 
colnames(spr483) <- c("Year","SPR", "Var")
spr483$SPRv <- rep("483", nrow(spr483))


spr48 <- rbind(spr481,
               spr482,
               spr483)

spr48 <- spr48 %>%
  mutate(SD = sqrt(Var))

spr48wide <- round(pivot_wider(spr48,
                          names_from = SPRv,
                          values_from = c(SPR, Var, SD),
                          values_fill = NA,
                          names_sep = " ",),3)

```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure11) show the SPR trends across years to 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3, indicating the references (yellow line = 75% SPR Objective and Red line = 20% Limit SPR).
